A java8 implementation of a decisiontable

My personal project to make myself fit for Java 8 and JavaFX.

The following functions will be implemented:
* UI for easy creation of a decision table
* Examination of the formal completeness of the decision table with optional display of lack of conditions.
* The syntactic analysis of the decision table
* Conversion of an extended decision table in a limited decision table
* Generating Java code from the decision table
